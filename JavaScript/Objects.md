# Objects

Objects are similar to `arrays`, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called `properties`.

Here's a sample object:

```javascript
var cat = {

  "name": "Whiskers",

  "legs": 4,

  "tails": 1,

  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]

};
```

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

## Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator

Here is a sample of using the dot operator (`.`) to read an object property:

```javascript
var myObj = {

  prop1: "val1",

  prop2: "val2"

};

var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1

var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2

```
